# AI Usage Declaration

## Overview

AI tools were used in this project to assist with documentation, debugging, and minor UI refinements. All design decisions, implementation logic, and final code structure remain my own.

## How AI Was Used

### 1. Documentation Assistance
AI was used to:
- Improve and refine JavaDoc comments (the comment blocks before methods)
- Ensure comments clearly describe method responsibilities
- Improve clarity and professionalism of documentation

All comments were reviewed and edited by me before final submission.

### 2. Debugging Support (UI Background Issue)

AI was consulted when I encountered issues changing the background picture in the JavaFX UI.

Specifically, AI helped me:
- Understand how JavaFX styling works
- Identify correct CSS usage
- Ensure proper linking between FXML and controller
- Resolve styling or layout conflicts

The final implementation was tested and adjusted manually by me.
